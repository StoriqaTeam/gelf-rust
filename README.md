*TODO: What's this library?*

*TODO: GELF example usecases*

## Features

*TODO: ::log-integration, list of backends, conversion of error levels*

## Install

To make use of GELF for Rust, simply add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`. Check for the latest
version at [cargo.io](https://cargo.io/gelf):

```toml
[dependencies]
cadence = "a.b.c"
```

If you installed [`cargo-edit`](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) you can easily add the latest
version by running:

```
cargo add gelf
```

Finally add the crate to your application:

```rust
extern crate gelf;
```

## Usage

*TODO: Standalone example, ::log example, different backends, refer to `/examples`*

## Documentation

The documentation is available at https://docs.rs/gelf and will get built automatically for every crate version.
